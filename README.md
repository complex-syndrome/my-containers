# My Containers
- Some containers I am running on a raspberry pi as a self-hosted server
- Currently using docker but will try other alternatives like LXC in the future

# Contents
- Minecraft self-hosted server
- DuckDNS
- WG-Easy

# Some notes for myself
- MACVLAN only works with ethernet connections
- Remember to turn on promiscuous mode when creating a network for IPVLAN
